- The purpose and goal of the project (e.g. This tool is designed to reverse the string encryption performed by malware X...)

- A description of how the tool works to solve that problem

- A list of files in the project and a short description of what each files are

- Installation and usage instructions, as clear as possible (the ideal would be a setup script or a list of copy-paste commands that are environment independent)

- Any limitations faced by the tool, and how it could be improved in the future
